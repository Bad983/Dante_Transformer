# Dante's Translator with Trasnformer

This repo contains all data we collected for our project.
You can find Dante's operas with translations, and it's a really hard work!

If you like our project and want to collaborate with us... you can!

We need to collect data with different Divina Commedia's or other Dante's operas paraphrases!

To adding new ones, upload your paraphrases in .csv format with correct index (row for row) on two columns, like ours!

Thank you!
